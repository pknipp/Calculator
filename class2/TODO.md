Stuff to do:
* Use a drop-down to handle the operation.
* Enable the handling of negative numbers.
* If possible (prob not),
refactor so that parent component (a class? index.js? app.js?) renders the following components: (a) an input field (twice, on either side of the following component) (b) operation selector (c) result (as simple tag?) (d) clear button
